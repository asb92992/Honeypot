# MHN-Admin Deployment
- I deployed it By following the instructions exactly and set up the GCP and deployed the MHN to it. I then deployed another cloud to run dionnaea, and use the MHN admin dash to monitor it. 

- Here is a gif of my googlel cloud dash

#Dioanaea Honeypot deployment
-  Dionnaea attracts attackers by creating and monitoring vulnerabilities that nmap or a port scanner will pick up. Dinaea is a fake server that is publlicly available. MHN helps admin view attacks, manage snort, connect, register, and send intrusion logs. Dionaea is the honeypot, and the vulnerabilities are the honey to attackers.
